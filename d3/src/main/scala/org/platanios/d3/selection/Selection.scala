/** Selections allow powerful data-driven transformation of the document object model (DOM): set attributes, styles,
  * properties, HTML or text content, and more. Using the data joinâ€™s enter and exit selections, you can also add or
  * remove elements to correspond to data.
  *
  * Selection methods typically return the current selection, or a new selection, allowing the concise application of
  * multiple operations on a given selection via method chaining.
  *
  * For example, to set the class and color style of all paragraph elements in the current document:
  * {{{
  *   d3.select.all("p")
  *     .attr("class", "graf")
  *     .style("color", "red")
  * }}}
  * This is equivalent to:
  * {{{
  *   val p = d3.select.all("p")
  *   p.attr("class", "graf")
  *   p.style("color", "red")
  * }}}
  *
  * By convention, selection methods that return the current selection use four spaces of indent, while methods that
  * return a new selection use only two. This helps reveal changes of context by making them stick out of the chain:
  * {{{
  *   d3.select("body")
  *     .append("svg")
  *       .attr("width", 960)
  *       .attr("height", 500)
  *     .append("g")
  *       .attr("transform", "translate(20,20)")
  *     .append("rect")
  *       .attr("width", 920)
  *       .attr("height", 460)
  * }}}
  *
  * Selections are immutable. All selection methods that affect which elements are selected (or their order) return a
  * new selection rather than modifying the current selection. However, note that elements are necessarily mutable, as
  * selections drive transformations of the document!
  *
  * @tparam E  Type of the selected element(s).
  * @tparam D  Datum type of the selected element(s).
  * @tparam PE Type of the parent element(s) in the selection.
  * @tparam PD Datum type of the parent element(s) in the selection.

    *
    * The data is specified for each group in the selection. If the selection has multiple groups (such as

    * from the data matrix.
    *
    * If a key function is not specified, then the first datum in data is assigned to the first selected element, the
    * second datum to the second selected element, and so on. A key function may be specified to control which datum is
    * assigned to which element, replacing the default join-by-index, by computing a string identifier for each datum
    * and element. This key function is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum
    * (`d`), the current index (`i`), and the current group (`nodes`), with this as the current DOM element
    * (`nodes(i)`). The returned string is the element's key. The key function is then also evaluated for each new datum
    * in `data`, being passed the current datum (`d`), the current index (`i`), and the group's new data, with this as
    * the group's parent DOM element. The returned string is the datum's key. The datum for a given key is assigned to
    * the element with the matching key. If multiple elements have the same key, the duplicate elements are put into the
    * exit selection. If multiple data have the same key, the duplicate data are put into the enter selection.
    *
    * For example, given this document:
    * {{{
    *   <div id="Ford"></div>
    *   <div id="Jarrah"></div>
    *   <div id="Kwon"></div>
    *   <div id="Locke"></div>
    *   <div id="Reyes"></div>
    *   <div id="Shephard"></div>
    * }}}
    * You could join data by key as follows:
    * {{{
    *   val data = js.Array(
    *     js.Dictionary("name" -> "Locke", "number" -> "4"),
    *     js.Dictionary("name" -> "Reyes", "number" -> "8"),
    *     js.Dictionary("name" -> "Ford", "number" -> "15"),
    *     js.Dictionary("name" -> "Jarrah", "number" -> "16"),
    *     js.Dictionary("name" -> "Shephard", "number" -> "31"),
    *     js.Dictionary("name" -> "Kwon", "number" -> "34"))

    *     .text((d: js.Dictionary[String]) => d("number"))
    * }}}
    * This example key function uses the datum `d` if present, and otherwise falls back to the element's `id` property.
    * Since these elements were not previously bound to data, the datum `d` is `null` when the key function is evaluated
    * on selected elements, and non-`null` when the key function is evaluated on the new data.
    *
    * The update and enter selections are returned in data order, while the exit selection preserves the selection order
    * prior to the join. If a key function is specified, the order of elements in the selection may not match their
    * order in the document. Use `Selection.order()` or `Selection.sort()` as needed. For more on how the key function
    * affects the join, see [A Bar Chart, Part 2](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2/) and
    * [Object Constancy](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/).
    *
    * Although the data-join can be used simply to create (to enter) a set of elements corresponding to data, more
    * generally the data-join is designed to let you create, destroy or update elements as needed so that the resulting
    * DOM corresponds to the new data. The data-join lets you do this efficiently by executing only the minimum
    * necessary operations on each state of element (entering, updating, or exiting), and allows you to declare concise
    * animated transitions between states as well.
    *
    * Here is a simple example of the [General Update Pattern](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218):
    * {{{
    *   val circle = svg.selectAll("circle")     // 1
    *     .data(data)                            // 2
    *     .style("fill", "blue")                 // 3
    *
    *   circle.exit().remove()                   // 4
    *
    *   circle = circle.enter().append("circle") // 5, 9
    *     .style("fill", "green")                // 6
    *     .merge(circle)                         // 7
    *     .style("stroke", "black")              // 8
    * }}}
    *
    * Breaking this down into discrete steps:
    *
    *   1. Any existing circles (that are descendants of the `svg` selection) are selected.
    *   2. These circles are joined to new `data`, returning the matching circles: the update selection.
    *   3. These updating circles are given a blue fill.
    *   4. Any existing circles that do not match new data â€” the exit selection â€” are removed.
    *   5. New circles are appended for any new data that do not match any existing circle: the enter selection.
    *   6. These entering circles are given a green fill.
    *   7. A new selection representing the union of entering and updating circles is created.
    *   8. These entering and updating circles are given a black stroke.
    *   9. These circles are stored in the variable circle.
    *
    * As described in the preceding paragraphs, the "matching" logic is determined by the key function passed to
    * `Selection.data()`. Since no key function is used in the above code sample, the elements and data are joined by
    * index.
    *
    * This method cannot be used to clear bound data; use `Selection.datum()` instead.
    *
    * For an introduction to D3â€™s data joins, see [Thinking With Joins](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/). Also see the
    * [General Update Pattern](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218) examples.

  /** Returns the enter selection: placeholder nodes for each datum that had no corresponding DOM element in the
    * selection. Note that the enter selection is empty for selections not returned by `Selection.data()`.
    *
    * The enter selection is typically used to create "missing" elements corresponding to new data. For example, to

    * {{{

    * }}}
    * If the body is initially empty, the above code will create six new DIV elements, append them to the body in-order,

    *   <div>16</div>
    *   <div>23</div>
    *   <div>42</div>
    * }}}
    * Conceptually, the enter selection's placeholders are pointers to the parent element (in this example, the document
    * body). The enter selection is typically only used transiently to append elements, and is often merged with the
    * update selection after appending, such that modifications can be applied to both entering and updating elements.

    * {{{
    *   div = div.data(Array(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), (d: Int) => d)
    * }}}
    * Since a key function was specified (as the identity function), and the new data contains the numbers `[4, 8, 16]`
    * which match existing elements in the document, the update selection contains three DIV elements. Leaving those
    * elements as-is, we can append new elements for `[1, 2, 32]` using the enter selection:
    * {{{
    *   div.enter().append("div").text((d: Int) => d)
    * }}}
    * Likewise, to remove the exiting elements `[15, 23, 42]`:
    * {{{
    *   div.exit().remove()
    * }}}
    * Now the document body looks like this:
    * {{{
    *   <div>1</div>
    *   <div>2</div>
    *   <div>4</div>
    *   <div>8</div>
    *   <div>16</div>
    *   <div>32</div>
    * }}}
    * The order of the DOM elements matches the order of the data because the old data's order and the new data's order
    * were consistent. If the new data's order is different, use `Selection.order()` to reorder the elements in the DOM.
    * See the [General Update Pattern](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218) example thread for more on data joins.
