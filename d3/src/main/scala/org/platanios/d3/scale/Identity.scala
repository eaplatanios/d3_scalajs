    * @param  domain    Domain for the new scale, that also acts as its range.
    * @param  nice      If `true`, the domain will be extended so that it starts and ends on nice round values. This
    *                   method typically modifies the scaleâ€™s domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest
    *                   round value. An optional tick count argument. "Nicing" is useful if the domain is computed from
    *                   data, say using `extent`, and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of
    *                   `[0.201479..., 0.996679...]`, a nice domain might be `[0.2, 1.0]`. If the domain has more than
    *                   two values, "nicing" the domain only affects the first and last value.
    * @param  niceCount Optional value that allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, when
    *                   `nice` is set to `true`, guaranteeing that the returned ticks will exactly cover the domain.
    * @return New scale.
